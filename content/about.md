Hi--I'm Aaron Van Bokhoven, a Software Developer living in Honolulu, Hawaii.

I like to develop software and design practical systems for the web. I primarily work with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Go, and JavaScript.

I currently work at [Real Geeks (Fidelity National Financial)](https://www.realgeeks.com/) as a Full Stack Software Developer. Previously I worked at Hawaii Camera and Buoy Alarm, both in an engineering role.

I'm a big fan of pair programming -- I believe it's an effective way to increase code quality and share knowledge by presenting opportunities to teach and learn.

In my free time I love learning about how things work; from programming languages to science, I often go down a rabbit hole of discovery. When I'm not indoors, I'm most likely sport climbing at the local crag or taking photos on the streets.
